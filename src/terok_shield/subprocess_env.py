"""Environment helper for spawned ``terok_shield`` child processes.

Centralises the ``PYTHONPATH`` shim every ``subprocess.run`` /
``Popen`` of ``sys.executable`` must use, so adding a new spawn site
can't silently regress the Nix-wrapped-Python fix.

    Threads the parent's ``sys.path`` through as ``PYTHONPATH`` so the
    child can import ``terok_shield`` regardless of how the parent was
    launched.  Under Nix, ``sys.executable`` is a wrapper script that
    rewrites the env on startup — but spawning it directly via
    ``subprocess`` / ``create_subprocess_exec`` bypasses that wrapper,
    leaving the child unable to find the ``terok_shield`` package.
    This shim restores it.

    *overrides* are applied on top of the parent env; ``PYTHONPATH``
    always wins so a stray ambient value can't shadow the parent's
    real import path.
